## Financial Instruments

### 1. Bonds

**Bond Valuation**
- Bond valuation involves understanding the relationship between interest and discounting, and between interest rates and present values. To derive the intrinsic value of a bond you need to assess:
- (1) The size of expected cash flows from the bond.
- (2) The timing of expected cash flows.
- (3) The discount rate or required rate of return demanded by investors.
- Risk managers are especially interested in changes to bond prices given changes in interest rates.

**Discounting and Present Value**
- Bonds are fixed income securities because interest payments (called coupons) and principal payments are specified at issuance and remain fixed for the life of the bond.
- The yield to maturity (YTM) is the rate of return expected of an asset. It is used to calculate the net present value of future cash flows and compare this amount to the initial investment.
- The present value of a bond is a function of the present value of the expected coupon payments and the present value of the principal amount due at maturity.
- Bond price up when: yield down
- Bond price down when: yield up

**Macaulay Duration as a Measure of Risk**
- Duration measure the interest rate risk of a bond, by measuring sensitivity of a bond to a change in interest rates.
- High duration is high interest rate risk, low duration is low interest rate risk.
- Interest rate risk is higher for long-term bond, and lower for short-term bonds.
- Macaulay Duration equals the cash-flow weighted average time to maturity of a bond.

**Duration and % Change in Bond Prices**
- **Duration (D):** Represents the sensitivity of the bond rate of return to fluctuations in yield. It estimates the changes in the price of a bond or other debt instrument as interest rates go up or down.
- Longer duration bonds have a higher sensitivity to changes in yield.

**Modified Duration as a Measure of Risk**
- Modified Duration = (Macaulay Duration) / (1 + YTM)
- Modified duration identifies how much a bond's price changes for each percentage change in the yield.
- Modified duration can be used as a risk measure for bond investors as it approximates how much a bond price could decline with an increase in interest rates.

**Bond Modified Duration Using Excel**
- Duration measures the inverse relationship between the yield of a bond and its price (if interest rates rise then bond prices fall, and vice versa).
- Calculating duration requires bond price, yield to maturity, time to maturity and discounted future cash inflows from the bond.

**Types of Fixed-Income Securities**
-(1) **Fixed-Coupon Bonds:** Pay a fixed percentage of the principal every period and the principal as a one-time payment at maturity
-(2) **Zero-Coupon Bonds:** Pay no coupons, payment is principal only. The return is derived from purchasing at a discount to face value and receiving face value at maturity.
-(3) **Annuities:** Pay a constant amount over time, which includes interest and a gradual repayment of principal.
-(4) **Preceptual bonds:** Have no set redemption date and the value is derived from interest payments only.
-(5) **Floating-Coupon Bonds:** Pay interest equal to a reference rate plus a yield spread. The reference rate (usually LIBOR) resets on a regular basis.
-(6) **Structured Notes:** Have complex payment patterns based on investor need.
-(7) **Inflation-Protected Notes:** Pincipal is indexed to the Consumer Price Index.

**Risk Premiums-Yield Spreads**
- Yield spreads refer to the difference between a bond's yield and a similar maturity risk-free bond.
- Yield Spread = YTM(T , Risk Bond) - YTM(T , Government Bond)
- It constitutes the addtional return an investor gets for differences in: 
- (1) Quality or risk of default (this is the creidt spread)
- (2) Call features
- (3) Coupons
- (4) Marketability/Liquidity
- (5) Tax treatments

**Bond Strategies and Management: Passive**
- Passive management strategies are driven by the investor's belief that securities are fairly-priced in the sense that the expected return is commensurate with the risk taken.
- Passive investors do not actively seek out trading opportunities to try to outperform the market.

**Bond Strategies and Management: Active**
- Some investors look for price appreciation in addition to income potential, thus have more active management strategies.
- An investor could lengthen (shorten) the average maturity of a bond portfolio when they expect interest rates to devline (rise).
- Bond managers can also profit from expected changes in interest rates by using bond futures and interest rate swaps to adjust the duration of their portfolio.


### Equities
- Common stock represents ownership in a corporation
- Unlike bonds, equities have uncertain cash flows because dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of a company
- This uncertainty makes equities more difficult to value than bonds
- Equities represent a residual claim because bonds and other creditors must be paid before equity if a company is to avoid default or bankruptcy.

**Common Stock Risks**
- (1) Market Risk: The chance of losses due to fluctuations in the stock market as a whole is referred to as market risk.
- (2) Interest Rate Risk: All securities, not just bonds are affected by interest rate movements. Interest rate risk affects common stocks because the market interest rate is a discount rate.
- (3) Business Risk: Involves the probability of a company suffering losses or profits less than expected because of adverse conditions.
- (4) Financial Risk: Also called leverage, involves the use of debt in financing the assets of a firm.
- (5) Systematic Risk: That part of the total variability directly associated with the variability of the overall market. Systematic risk cannot be reduced by diversification.
- (6) Un-Systematic Risk: That part of total risk not related to overall market variability. Attributable to the unique factors affecting a particular company. Un-systematic risk can be reduced by diversification. 

**Measures of Equity Risk**
- Threre are three main measures of Equity Risk:
- (1) Standard Deviation or Volatility
- (2) Beta which is also called Market Risk, Systematic Risk or Undiversifiable Risk
- (3) Value-at-Risk (VaR)

### Derivaties and Managing Market Risk
- Derivatives are traded in both the over-the-counter-marekt and on organized exchanges.
- They are private contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, reference rate or index.
- In contrast to securities, such as stocks and bonds, which are issued to raise capital, derivatives are private contracts between two parties. 

**Introduction to Derivatives: Counterparty Credit Risks**
- The derivatives market is huge
- The size of the derivatives market is also driven by their cost-effectiveness when used to manage risk
- A major issue with derivatives is countryparty risk, as the contract itself gives rise to credit risk
- Counterparty risk can also be managed by a clearinghouse, which is a financial institution that provides settlement and clearing services for financial transactions that take place either on an exchange or over-the-counter.

**Introduction to Derivatives: Clearinghouses**
- A clearinghouse reduces counterparty risk by acting as the counterparty to every buyer and seller.
- Clearinghouses reduce their countryparty risk in several ways:
- (1) They allow netting of transactions between counterparties.
- (2) They also have in place credit risk procedures that call for collateral deposits to be maintained and are adjusted at least daily.
- (3) Contracts are marked-to-market based on an independent evaluation of trades and if a member does not post additional collateral as required the clearinghouse has the right to liquidate the position.
- (4) Clearinghouses also rely on a guarantee fund provided by memebers that can be used to cover losses in case of default.

**Forward Contracts**
- Forward contracts are private agreements to exchange a given asset against cash or possibly another asset at a fixed futre point in time.
- The terms of the contract include quantity of units or shares, date, and price at the time of exchange.
- Forward contracts are contractual obligations because the exchange must take place, unless a default occurs.
- The value of a forward contract is determined by the relationship between the current spot price and the agreed forward price. For example, a wheat farmer could enter a forward contract to lock in the price now for delivery of wheat in the future, in thsi case the farmer is hedged against changes in prices.

**Swap Contracts**
- Swap contracts are over-the-counter agreements to exchange a series of cash flows according to specified terms.
- The underlying asset could be an interest rate, an exchange rate, an equity, a commodity or any index.
- Swaps tend to have longer maturities than forwards and futures.
- Swaps can be viewed as a sequential series of forward contracts.
- Swaps exist for Interest Rates, Commodities, Currencies, Debt - Equity, and Creidt Default Swaps.

**Fixed Rate Bond Investors: Pay Fixed Swap**
- Bond investors in the U.S. normally receive fixed-rate coupons
- Bond Fund Managers may want to protect their returns against increases in interest rates.
- Result: Fund manager has a synthetic floating rate exposure

**Futures Contracts Basic**
- A future contract is a commitment to buy or sell at a specified future settlement date a designated amount of a commodity.
- The seller (short) of the futures contract agrees to make delivery, and the buyer (long) of the contract agrees to take delivery at a currently detemrined market price.

**Financial Futures Market Pariticipants**
- Financial futures give investors more of an opportunity to fine-tune the risk and return characteristics of their portfolios.
- Participants in the future market have been classified as either hedgers or speculators:
- (1) Hedgers buy or sell futures contracts in order to offset the risk in a cash position. Hedgers must make timing decisions as to when to initiate and end the process, and, as conditions change, hedgers must adjust their hedge strategy.
- (2) Speculators buy or sell futures contracts in an attempt to earn a return. Speculators are willing to accept the risk of price fluctuations in order to profit from them.

**Hedging with Futures**












## Managing and Modeling Market Risk


## Market Risk Measurement Systems

**Introduction**
- Risk maangement has moved from return-based to position-based. **Posititon-based risk measures are more informative** because they can be used to manage portfolios/
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** is a statistical measure of how much a portfolio might lose within a specified confidence interval over a set time horizon.
- **Stress testing**, in comparison, identidies possible losses under extreme market conditions that may not show up in the recent history.

**Weaknesses of Notional Limits and Sensitivity Measures**
- **Financial exposure** can be related to either market, credit or operational risk but often these 3 categories interact with each other.
- In the past risk managers used to use **notional limits and sensitivity measures**. These measures though do not provide consistent estimates of the potential for downside loss across a portfolio.
- **Duration is an example of a sensitivity meausre**, and it measures the sensitivity of a bond to interest rates, but duration does not answer the question of what is the probability of a change in interest rates.
- **Sensitivity measures** also do not allow positions to be aggregated across all markets.
- **VaR provides information on all weaknesses of notional and sensitivity measures**. Notional and sensitivity measures continue to be usefil to set limits and to control risk.
- **Stop losses** are another tool used by risk maangers to control risk. Stop losses are **rules enforcing position cuts after losses occur**.

**Risk Measurement Systems**
Risk measurement systems combine 3 steps:
1. Collect portfolio positions and map the positions to risk factors
2. From market data, construct the distribution of risk factors
3. Construct the distribution of portfolio returns using 1 of 3 methods (parametric, historical, Monte Carlo), and summarize the downside risk with VaR

- The **true level of risk** can be **greater or lower than the VaR** measure.
- Risk factors need to be chosen, and risk factors represent a subset of all market variables that adequately span the risks of the portfolio.
- The key is to choose market forces that are adequate for the portfolio. In general, the more complex the strategy the greater the number of risk factor that should be used.
- Risk managers must make reasonable approximations to develop a cost-efficient measure of risk.




## Downside Risk Measures

**Downside Risk Measures: VaR**
1. **VaR: Historical Simulation**
- Simulates the current portfolio using recent history.
- Use market data to construct a frequency distribution (histogram) of daily returns. This is based on ordered losses from worst to best.
- The goal is to summarize the distribution by one number, the level of loss that will not be exceeded at some confidence level.
2. **VaR: Monte Carlo**
- Monte Carlo simulations assume particular density for the distribution of risk factors and then draw random samples from these distributions to generate returns on the portfolio.
3. **VaR: Caveats**
- VaR does not describe the worst possible loss. It bases its calculation on a confidence level.
- VaR is measured with some error and is subject to normal sampling variation.
- VaR does not describe the losses in the left tail since it represents the area under curve between the mean and the confidence interval.

**Conditional VaR: Expected Shortfall**
- Expected Shortfall
- How much can we expect to lose once the VaR loss is exceeded?
- Measures the average loss givent the VaR loss has been exceeded!
- Average loss in left tail.

**VaR Parameters: Confidence Level**
- VaR requires 2 quantitative parameters: The confidence level and the time horizon.
- **Confidence level:**
- The choice of the confidence level depends on the use of VaR. Typically, VaR is used to measure downside risk, so what matters most is consistency of the VaR confidence levels across trading desks and time.
- If VaR is used to decide how much capital to set aside to avoid bankcruptcy then a higher confidence level would be required.
- VaR models should also be back-tested to determine the frequency of losses that exceeded VaR at a specific confidence level over a given time period.
- **TimeHorizon/Liquidity Horizon**
- The longer the time horizon the greater the VaR measure.
- Time horizon is also called liquidity horizon because when a VaR loss (or bigger is made) it is likely that part of the portfolio will have to be sold off to limit losses and reduce risk.
- If the portfolio contains illiquid assets, it may take several days to sell them off.
- VaR can be extended from a one-day horizon to more days by multiplying VaR by the square root of time. This adjustment is valid with independent and identically distributed returns that have a normal distribution.

**VaR Parameters: Basel Committee Rules**
- Before adopting Expected Shortfall as their preferred risk measure, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision laid out minimum capital requirements for banks to cover market risk of their trading portfolios.
- The rules define a market risk charge based on the bank's internal VaR measures and require:
1. A horizon of 10 trading days or 2 calendar weeks,
2. A 99% confidence level, and
3. An observation period based on at least a year of historical data and updated at least once a quarter.
- The rules allow the 10-day VaR to be calculated from the 1-day VaR:
- VaR(99%,10-Day) = VaR(99%,1-Day) * sqrt(10)


## Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis

**Stress Testing Definition**
- A Stress Test is a projection of the financial condition of a firm or economy under a specific set of severely adverse conditions
- One or multiple risk factors
- Simple or complex scenarios
- Extreme but plausible likelihood

**Stress Testing after Financial Crisis of 2007-08**
- During the recession that started in 2007 risk management systems failed at many firms, and many firms realized losses that were far greater and more frequent than what they had anticipated.
- VaR is a very good measure but like many other measures it has limitations. The lesson learned from the 2007 recession is that relying on recent data may not be sifficient to assess risks, which is why VaR models need to be supplemented by stress tests.
- Stress tests strive to identify events that could cause extreme but plausible losses. By adding assumptions, however, stress tests are more subjective than VaR measures.

**Stress Testing: Purpose**
- Inform risk appetite framework
- Allow management to set appropriate risk policies
- Ensure risk exposure does not exceed capital and liquidity availability
- Ensure a firm can survive an extreme but plausible event
- Identify and assess magnitude of tail risks

**Stress Testing Components and Considerations**
- **Stress testing includes**
- Stressing models, volatilities, and correlations
- Developing responses
- **Considerations**
- Scenario Generation
- Identify risk drivers
- Data availability and quality
- Modeling capability
- Stress test calculation
- Results aggregation and reporting

**Stress Testing Scenarios**
- Stress tests are best deployed for high severity scenarios that have fewer risk factors, while scenario analysis has multiple risk factors that could be triggered as volatility catalysts. However, both should focus on extreme but plausible events.

**Stress Testing: Event Risk**
- Stress testing is useful to guard against event risk, which often arises from emerging risks and strategic risks. The nature of these risks is that they do not occur frequently and may be difficult to anticipate but when they do occur the results are often catastrophic. These risks can come from:
- Monetary or fiscal policies
- Environmental changes and extreme weather
- Marketplace disruptions from new technology or participants
- Geo-political risks

**Stress Testing: Design and Construction**
- Scneario Analysis and Stress tests are not easy to design and build, but recent years have shown that colatility is increasing, and markets can be taken by surprise.
- The goal of both is to ensure the firm can withstand extreme but lausible scenarios without going bankcrupt.

**Scenario Analysis: Definition**
- Scenario analysis is a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive resoned assessments of the likelihood and loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses. 
- Examines and evaluates possible future events
- Scenarios may be possible but unlikely
- Need not be derived from historical events
- History can provide a great starting point

**Scenario Analysis: Purpose**
- Prepare for unexpected events
- Identify key risk exposures, especially emerging risks and strategic risks
- Explore potential extreme events
- Mitigate risk of liquidity and solvency

**Scneario analysis: Design**
- A scenario analysis puts a portfolio through a test that has large movements in financial market variables. These scenarios can be created by using various methods:
- Moving key variables one at a time because it is not likely that all variables move all at once.
- Using historical scenarios, such as the 1987 market crash.
- Or the February-March 2020 Covid global market selloff.
- Creating possible scenarios, by assessing the worst thing that could happen to existing positions.
- Reserve stress tests, assuming a large loss and then explore those situations that would give rise to that loss.
