## Credit Risk
- Credit exposure arising from the risk of non-payment and non-performance

### Three parties in Credit Analysis
- Lender, Investor
- Borrower, Issuer, Counterparty, Client
- Markets

### Workflow for risk decision
(1) Industry, business model, business environment + Risk analysis + Credit and financial analysis <br>
(2) Insight, judgment + Risk expereicnes, history, lessons learned <br>
(3) Overall risk assessment + Overall risk strategy <br>
(4) Risk decision <br>

### Risk Assessment: Strategy and Decision-Making
(1) Risk assessment <br>
- Financial analysis 
- Financial proposal <br>

(2) Risk strategy and outlook <br>
- Long-term exposure outlook
- Increase, maintain, decrease, withdraw <br>

(3) Risk decisions <br>
- Consistent with risk assessment
- Consistent with risk strategy
- Consistent with risk outlook <br>


### The argument and presentation will likely include the following and flow in the manner below:
- Industry, business model, business environment
- Risk analysis: Primary business risks, mitigants, financial impact, management response
- Management assessment (performance, growth, crisis response, operations efficiencies, succession, corporate culture, public reputation and brand)
- Financial analysis ("The financial story")
- Overall risk assessment, risk rating, risk outlook, risk strategy
- Financing needs, proposals, expected credit exposure, transaction structure
- Conclusions/recommendations, execution plans

</br>

## Credit and Financial Analysis
- **Assess creditworthiness:** The ability of the borrower (obligor) to make future contractual payments: interest payments and principal repayments
- Credit analysis will be used to assess and manage risks arising from many other activities, as well: countryparty trading, financial processing, cash-management activity, etc.
- **Establish the lender's (or creditor or debt investor's) position** for repayment vis a vis other lender (senior, junior, subordinated positions; secured, unsecured positions; short-term, long-term exposures)
- **Determine secondary sources** of repayment or other forms of recourse </br>
(1) Primary sources of payback </br>
(2) Secondary sources of payback </br>


### Corporate Balance Sheet
| Asset | Liability |
| ---- | ---- |
| Operating assets | Accrued Expenses |
|Fixed assets | Short-term debt |
| Intangible | Long-term debt |
| | Capital |


### Credit Analysis: Debt Purpose and Payback
- Tracking the purpose of the financing helps explain and highlight the primary source of repayment (e.g. cash from operations).
- The use and purpose of funds borrowed should be deployed to generate sources of payback: cash from revenues, related asset sales, etc.
- If the primary source declines or disappears, are there other sources? Is there a secondary source?

### Financial Analysis: Benefits and Deficiencies
**Benefits:** </br>
- Measures performance over time
- Measures financial condition at a point in time
- Detects trends that indicate or reinforce notions of strategy, business models, long-term growth
- Highlights vulnerabilities, worst-case scenarios, and company's "readiness" for downturns
- Provides ways to detect inconsistencies, flaws deceptions by management or possible fraud
- Used as starting point to project financial performance or the impact of worst-case scenarios
- Contribute substantially to risk ratings, strategy, and risk decisions

**Deficiencies:** </br>
- Presents an assessment based on past performance (old numbers)
- May overlook qualitative factors and current operating environment

### Goal
- Primary goal in credit analysis is to use information and insight to rate the following to: </br>
(1) Conclude on the company's financial condition </br>
(2) Assess whether the company can meet financial obligations. </br>

| --- | --- |
| Operating cash flows | Operations and controls |
| Asset quality, efficiency, productivity | Crisis preparation |
| Working capital | Market reputation |

## Expected Loss

### Credit Risk Management: Expected Loss
- Financial institutions (banks, investors) manage risk by determining the "Expected Loss" for individual exposures and for an entire portfolio
- Expected loss is based, in part, on the credit rating derived from credit analysis
- Institutions and investors manage risks in the portfolio by analyzing trends in expected loss
- Banks use "Expected Loss" to detemrine loan-loss reserves
- Institutions and investors will also want to be compensated for risks based on "Expected Loss"

### Why "Expected Loss"?
- Portfolio management
- Basis for loan pricing and loan-loss reserves and charge-offs
- Credit risk management and risk decisions
- Industry risk management
- Risk capital allocation
- Regulatory-capital calculations: From Expected Loss to Unexpected Loss
- Reconcilliation with credit ratings, ratings assessments

## Understanding Defaults

### Credit Default
- Non-payment of principal or interest or other form of payment when due
- Non-payment after remedial, waiver, or cure period
- Non-payment after breach of financial covenant
- Non-performance (pledge of collateral, e.g.) as required by document
- Cross-default: Default applicable to separate third party lender/counterparty
- Exchange of debt: Exchange of one debt instrument for another with reduced value

### Credit Risk Management: Default Probability
- Probability of Default is based on Credit rating and Outlook Industry


### Credit Risk Management: Loss Given Default
- Loss Given Default = (1 - Recovery Rate)


## Risks vs Rewards

**Loan and  Debt Pricing**
- Base rate: (1) Cost of funding, (2) Risk-free rate
- Credit Spread: (1) Expected Loss = PD x LGD

## Debt Investors

### Credit Analysis: Debt Investors
- Debt investors include those who have made private-placement investments (notes) and those who have purchased public debt sucurities (bond, notes, debentures, convertible bonds, etc.).
- Debt investors seek to be paid interest and principal and want to protect themselves against default, while earning a return that compensate them for risks they endure.


## Assigning Ratings
- Investors and analysts will translate ratings-agency ratings into credit spreads to determine risk-based loan and bond pricing


| Rating | Default frequency | Default Probabiltiy |
| --  |   ---  |  --- |
| Fitch, S&P, Moody's | The rating and the tenor of the exposure can be mapped into an historical default frequency for that rating | The analyst can use the default frequency of that rating as a basis to derive probability of default for a defined tenor |
| | Based on past data, what percentage of debt outstanding in that ratings group defaulted over the defined tenor? | A credit spread accounts for "expected loss" or [Probability of default] x [Loss-given-default] |


## Understanding Default Trends

### Default Rates: Trends
**General trends: Global probability of default**
- Default rates, based on outstanding debt in selected years
- Using historical default rates to project "probability of default" going forward
- Determining "through the cycle" or "point in time" default rates
- Investment-grade names continue to perform as expected, deserving the ratings they earned.
- Non-investment trends show no discernible pattern yet.
- Overall default statistics may also reflect the declining performance of one or two significant, large borrowers.
- Statistics show ratings are fairly good predictors of probabilities of default.
- Defaults of AA-rated names occured in 1999 and 2008.

**Default vs. Credit Deterioration**
- Credit analysts often try to analyze markets, industries and financial information to determine a probability of default for a specific borrower
- Analyst will also try to use the same to determine not just default probability, but the likelihood that the borrower will decline or deteriorate in performance from year to year
- Analysts measure the probability that credit ratings "migrate" or "transition" to lower grades - thus causing increases in borrowing costs or credit spreads.
- They measure "time to default" or "path to default". Companies with high ratings may default but will have declined over an extended period.

## Market Indicators and Credit Models

### Default Rates: Market Indicators

**Market indicators and indices**
- Examples: KMV, CDS, bonds spreads, CreditSights, BondScore, CreditGrades, Credit Risk Monitor
- Based on equity and bond markets, investor sentiment, market behavior
- Implied ratings and projected default rates fluctuate regularly
- Not often based on financial-analysis rigor, conventions
- Use some historical default statistics
- Useful as convenient input, tool to estimate forward default rates
- Rating, scores, or grades translate into projected default rate

**KMV, CDS, bonds spreads, CreditSights, BondScore, CreditGrades**
- 1. Company information, Company performance, Company financial reports
- 2. Market perceptions/interpretations of company information, Market assessment and analysis of creditworthiness
- 3. **Market indicator and indices, Implied default probability**
- Market metrics and indices are used to provide updated, implied credit ratings, risks and default probabilities

**Market indicators from credit spreads (bonds, loans, derivatives) can be used to infer a market-implied probability of default**

| Product| Credit spread | Implied probability of default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bond CDS | Credit spread = PD x LGD | PD = [Credit spread]/LGD |

- Based on historical defaults and bankruptcies, assume LGD = 0.40
- PD = [Credit spread]/0.4
- Map the implied probability to a credit rating
- Examine default-frequency data provided by ratings agencies

**KMV Model**
- Structural Models, Merton Models
- Equity prices
- Options model
- Market values of assets
- Liabilities
- MV-assets - Liabilities
- Implied default probabilitis
- Implied ratings

**CDS Spreads**
- Risk spreads
- Market values
- Expected Loss
- Implied default probabilities

**Bond Spreads**
- Credit spreads
- Expected Loss
- Implied default probabilities

**Credit Portfolio Risk Models**
- Some credit-risk models use historical data and market prices to attempt to compute a current perception of probability of default. Models can be classified in different types.
- **Top Down:** Macro approach
- **Bottom up :** Each obligor assessed
- **Default:** Examining default events and default probabilities
- **MTM (Credit "VaR):** Examining credit deterioration or migration
- **Structural:** Assessment of balance-sheet assets > liabilities (distance to default), examining market volatility of assets
- **Conditional:** Updating or tying default rates to a defined scenario
- **Unconditional:** Default rates remain the same
- **Intensity or Reduced Form:** Inferring default rates from market indicators (CDS, bond spreads)

## Portfolio Management Concepts

### Credit Risk Portfolio Management

**Objective: Determine the expected loss for a portfolio of credit exposures**
- Credit portfolio managers attempt to measure and manage the expected loss for an entire portfolio of credit exposures - including loan exposure and/or corporate-bond exposures (and other types of credit risks - including committed exposures or counterparty trading exposures).
- For banks, portfolio expected loss will be used as benchmark to determine credit provisions and loan-loss-allowances.
- Banks and credit managers will also attempt to compute unexpected loss - based on determinations of expected loss. (Unexpected loss is the basis for bank regulatory capital requirements)
- Portfolio expected and unexpected losses must consider the impact of loan maturities (tenors) and loan correlations.

**Porfolio Management: Expected Loss**
| Loan | Exposure ($ millions) | Default Probability | Loss given Default | Expected Loss |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loan 1 | 100 | 2% | 5% | 0.100 |
| Loan 2 | 150 | 3% | 25% | 1.125 |
| Loan 3 | 75 | 1% | 10% | 0.075 |
| Loan 4 | 100 | 4% | 10% | 0.400 |
| Loan 5 | 200 | 1% | 75% | 1.500 |
| Loan 6 | 135 | 2% | 10% | 0.270 |
| Loan 7 | 100 | 3% | 35% | 1.050 |
| Loan 8 | 265 | 2% | 15% | 0.795 |
|TOTAL | 1,125 |    |     | 5.320 or 0.47% |

**Concepts in Portfolio Management**
- Default and recovery risks
- Concetration risk
- Correlation risk
- Incremental or Marginal risk
- Pricing risks

**Porfolio Management: Unexpected Loss**
- Unexpected loss for each loan accounts for losses beyond expected loss and is based on historical variance (volatility) in default frequencies/probabilities for each rating 
- For bank regulation, Basel III quantifies unexpected loss, based on 99% confidence ranges (2.33 SDs)

**Porfolio Management: Concentration Risks**
- Concentration may be measured based on individual loans or groupings of loans by industries, currencies or geographies.
- The HHI (Herfindahl-Herschmann Index) can be used to measured trends in concentration
- 0 > HHI > 1
- HHI = 100%, if there is one loan in the portfolio; HHI = 1%, if there are 100 loans, each with 1% portion
- HHI above 20.7% and can be measured over time and compared to peer firms

**Porfolio Management: Default Correlation**
- The performance of individual loans can be correlated. Defaults on certain individual loans can occur at the same time, if they are highly correlated.
- If probability of default can be derived or determined and if expected loss and unexpected loss are calculated, then how must default correlation be treated? Portfolio managers address effective methods of addressing correlation

### Value at Risk: Market VaR to Credit VaR
- Portfolio of securities and derivatives position subject to **market** risk
- **Market VaR:** Defined worst-case loss in market value over defined time period based on market factors
- Portfolio of investments, loans and credit exposures subject to **credit** risks
- **Credit VaR:** Defined worst-case loss in value over defined time period based on deteriorating creditworthiness or decline in credit rating
- In the way that market risk amangers seek to compute a "Value at Risk" (worst-case loss), credit portfolio managers consider computing a Credit VaR
- With access to selected data over time, they seek to measure what the market VaR provides - a calculation of maximum loss (unpected), due to credit deterioration, with a certain degree of confidence (95%, 99%)
- How will loss distributions be determined? How will confidence ranges be determined? (Percentiles, standard deviations)
- Credit vaR is maximum loss based on credit deterioration. Contrast with "Unexpected Loss, " based on events of default

**Credit VaR**
- Ratings-migration data can be used to determine with a certain level of confidence how far company's issuer rating can deteriorate over a defined timeframe
- If the rating declines, then the market value of the bond or loan will decline (to account for the higher credit spread)
- Based on prior data and a confidence level (95%-99%), the analyst determines the greatest migration or lowest bond rating over, say, one year and computes the expected price of the bond one year from now
- The loss in value over the time frame would be considered the "Credit VaR"(also referred to as "unexpected loss") 



## Risk Mitigation

### Credit Risk Mitigation

**Credit Risk Management involves managing the risk of a portfolio of loans and/or debt investments. The goals of risk manaement may include:**
- Limiting or reducing, or hedging the risk accepted
- Requesting adequate compensation for the risk accepted, often known as risks-vs, -rewards analysis
- Transferring or mitigating risk in specific transactiosn, industries or across a portfolio

**Steps:**
(1) Risk capacity, tolerance, and appetite
(2) Risk decisions, Risk management
(3) Risk reduction, Risk transfer or sales, Risk hedging

### Various Risk-mitigation Tools

**Portfolio Risk Management: Risk Mitigation**
- Analyze default risks thoroughly, regularly
- Establish policy and guidelines
- Set limits and benchmarks
- Sell off exposures 
- Seek third-party support
- Securitize exposures
- Purchase credit insurance (derivatives)

</br>

**Methods or techniques to reduce risks or exposures**
|Method, tool, technique | Observation |
| -- | -- |
| Discipline at origination | Requires objective, in-depth financial analysis, awareness of borrower vulnerability and industry downturn |
| Concentration limits | Must manage business-growth objectives, market opportunities |
| Loan sales | Requires active secondary-market trading unit, subject to market demand and pricing, risk-retention rules |
| Single-name CDS | Requires CDS hedging, trading group, subject to MTM and collateral requirements, counterparty risks, subject to brokerage and settlement margin requirements (central depositary, e.g.). |
| Financial guarantees | Depends on risk and asset and support providers, subject to legal interpretation of guarantee of payment, support or reimbursement |
| Securitization | Depends on asset class, industries, subject to channels for securitization, subject to Basel III and accounting rules for risk retention, VIE consolidations, and implied support |
| Index CDS, index tranche CDS, credit insurance | Requires CDS trading unit, subject to MTM exposures and counterparty risks, subject to collateral and margining, subject to basis risks and correlations |

### Credit Mitigation: Securitization & Credit-Default Swap

**Credit Mitigation: Securitization**
- The bank can sell the portfolio to an SPV (CLO, e.g.), but must ensure the sale does not require the bank to repurchase the portfolio if credit quality declines

**Credit Mitigation: Credit-Default Swap**
- **Referenced credit asset:** (1) Company, (2) Sovereign, (3) Index
- **Bank, lender or investor:** (1) Buying protection against default of credit asset, (2) Transferring risk
- **Counterparty:** (1) Selling protection, (2) Accepting Risk
- Bank pays Counterparty the credit premium
