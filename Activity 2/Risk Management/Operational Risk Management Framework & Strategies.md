## What is Operational Risk and How is it Managed?

**Operational Risk for Financial Institutions**
- Operational risk is instrinsic to financial institutions and poses a significant threat to their financial solvency.
- Developments in information systems and computing technology have facilitated improvements in the measurement and management of operational risk.
- The same technological advancements that are reshaping today's business environment are also likely expose financial institutions to even greater operational risks in the future.
- Financial institutions and regulators must continue to strengthen their approach to managing and mitigating operational risk.

**Three-Lines of Defense Risk Management**
- **First line of defense:** Functions that own and manage risk
- **Second line of defense:** Functions that oversee or specialize in risk management, compliance
- **Third line of defense:** Functions that provide independent assurance, above all internal audit

**Definitions of Operational Risk**
**Narrow (Basel II, BCBS*)**
Risk of losses resulting from:
- Inadequate or failed internal processes,
- people and 
- systems or
- from external events
- Including: legal risk (as fraud constitudes the most significant Op Risk loss events category and a legal issue,
- Excluding strategic & reputational risks

**Wide**
BCBS definition is artificial, primarily for regulatory capital calculation.
- The largest Op Risk component - Business risk - OMITTED
- Reputational risk (biggestbiz risk!) - EXCLUDED
- All risks, other than credit and market, which could cause volatility of revenues, expenses, and value of the bank's business.

**Reputation Risk is an Op Risk**
- Reputation is a key asset of a financial institution, as it represents its past and future prospects, describe its attractiveness for the stakeholders as compared to competitors
- Risk Quantification is difficult.
- 3 Elements of Rep Risk Management:
- (1) Crisis management (acute risks management) - based on catastrophic Op Riks management
- (2) Risk management (latent reputational challenges)
- (3) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

**Operational Risk is Enterprise-wide**
- Operational Risk Management allows us to look across the Enterprise in a holistic manner to create a detailed Risk Profile that business-line managers and senior management can use to better run their businesses.

**Types of Operational Risk**
Risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
- Process Risks - Execution, Delivery, Process Management, Business Disruption, Systems Failure
- Conduct Risks - Clients, Products, Business Practices, Employment Practices, Internal Theft, Fraud
- External Risks - External Theft and Fraud, Damage to Physical Assets

**Sources of Operational Risks**
- Business Practices: Inappropriate business safeguarding of customer or proprietary information assets; cyber-security
- Continuity of Business: Inability to continue business during a contingency event
- Employment Practices: Inappropriate employment practices and workplace environment
- Vendor Management: Risks not eliminated, poor practices

## Operational Risk as a discipline
| | History | Risk Measurement | Risk Mitigation Tools |
| -- | -- | -- | --|
| Credit Risk | Age > 60 yrs, Portfolio view > 45 yrs, Quantitative > 30 yrs, Active mitigation > 25 yrs | Value at Risk based on: (1) Prob. of Default - ORR (Obligor Risk Rating), (2) LGD - FRR (Facility - Risk Rating) | Target market/portfolio; Risk-based capital; Credit approval process; Assignments/syndicates; Credit derivatives |
| Market Risk | Age > 40 yrs, Portfolio view > 30 yrs, Quantitative > 25 yrs, Active mitigation > 20 yrs | Value at Risk based on: (1) Factor Sensitivity, (2) Potential Losses | Risk-based capital; Boundaries; Diversification Hedging positions |
| Operational Risk | Age < 15 yrs, Portfolio view... TBD, Quantitative < 10 yrs, Active mitigation culture? | Value at Risk based on: (1) Loss frequency, (2) Loss severity, (3) Metrics / Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) | Risk-based capital tied to pace of business growth; Infrastructure investment, planning people management and training

**Operational Risk Management Objectives**
- Manage the frequency and severity of events and losses
- Scale operational risk exposure (quantitative, qualitative) to conform to an acceptable level of risk
- Ensure adequate controls to maintain exposure and financial/reputation risk within acceptable levels
- Determine the appropriate level of capital to absorb extreme losses associated with risks that are difficult to control or where the control mechanism fails.

**Operational Risk Management Tools**
The Tools of Operational Risk Management:
- Loss capture for causal analysis (to get preventive measures), capital modeling
- Assessments (Self, Audit, Regulator) for view on control effectiveness), residual risk
- Metrics (KRI) warn of imbalances and serve to attract management attention
- Scenario analysis dimensions potential frequency and severity, unexpected losses
- Capital aids the firm's solvency; capital allocation informs management decisions

**Operational Risk Measurement Challenges**
- Potential losses are practically unbounded 
- Exposure is undefined and undimensioned 
- Losses are not capped, e.g. by Credit Risk Limits or Market Risk Stop Losses
- Observed loss amounts are not simplt related to firm size although some evidence of deep pockets premium e.g. lawsuits and regulatory settlements.
- Loss severity distributions are fat-tailed.
- Capital need is driven by the risk of infrequent but extremely large events

**Op Risk Management Equation**
| Inherent Risk | - | Mitigation or 'Hedge' | = | Residual Risk | < or = | Risk Appetite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identified & Classified | | Controls, Designed & Implemented | | Informed by Losses, Metrics, Scenarios | | Top-Down Quantitative & Qualitative |
| Basel with bespoke, Adjustments | | Assess & Test Design AND Effectivness | | Assessed and Independently Tested | | Re-tested against Scenarios, Capital |
| Jointly determined - Business & Risk | | Primary role of Business Management | | Primary role of Operation Risk Management | | Board, Senior Management, Risk Management


**The Cost-Benefit Proposition in Op Risk**
- Process-focus and optimization, integrated with Business Objectives
- Entire Approach oriented towards Risk with respect to Appetite
- Forward-looking view of Severity, Frequency, Onset
- Inform about Cost-Benefit-Risk Tradeoffs and Pricing
- Provide key inputs for investment decisions and governance 
- Design Capital program as a dynamic tool to measure and manage
- Provide the basis for clear actions with respect to: (1) Business Strategy, (2) Business Process, (3) Remediation priorities across business lines

## Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)
- RSCA is a critical component for risk management framework

**Main Operational Risk Management Tools**
(1) **Risk and Control Self-Assessment**
- Interviews, surveys
- Qualitative assessment
- Risk mapping
- Priorities setup

(2) **Loss event Database**
- Standardized Registration
- Centralized storage
- RCSA approval
- Quantitative assessment

(3) **Scenario Modeling & Analysis**
- Process descriptions
- Weaknesses search
- Op Risk testing
- Analysis (KRI, limits)
- Re-engineering

(4) **Key Risk Indicators**
- Risk monitoring
- Trend analysis
- Comparisons
- Reasoning
- Proactive management

**RCSA: Proactive Risk Identification & Management Tool
- Business lines & support functions assess controls in their area;
- RCSA provides systematic means to identify: (1) Risk clusters (concentrations), (2) Control duplications/gaps or over-controls
- and to set up: (1) prevention & control measures and (2) corrective action plans
- Was originally an Internal Audit tool, facilitates a risk-focused approach to Internal Audit;
- RCSA proactive as opposed to Op Loss Reporting
- Allocates front line responsibility for ORM directly with management -> corrective actions are more effective & timelier.

**RCSA Objectives**
- **Identify** Op Risks
- **Asess** and quantify the institution's exposure to Op Risks
- **Evaluate** the prevention & control system
- **Mitigate** the risks

**Risk and Control Self-Assessment WORKFLOW**
- (1) Define the implementation mode / Document the process
- (2) Identify & Assess Op Risks (including risk scoring)
- (3) Identify Controls (Preventative & Detective)
- (4) Assess & rate the controls (exante & ex-post)
- (5) Controls improper or are Non-existent
- (6) Update KRIs, adjust scenario analysis, enhance controls & training 
- (7) Follow-up on Implementation
- (8) Report Results/Analyze Residual Risks

**Management Results Reporting Tools**
- Unless RCSA results are relevant for management decision making, the exercise is no more than an expensive awareness tool
- Management Reporting through dashboards / heat maps / scorecards

**Heat Mapping**
- Facilitates the assessment of the likelihood and impact of the risk materializing; Can aslo be used to help determining the "top" risks
- E.g. Frequency-Severity Matrix, Frequency-Severity-Control Matrix

**RCSA Follow Up**
- RCSA results ought to be used in conjunction with other components of ORM Framework.
- **Internal Event Data:** (1) Highlight areas susceptible to Op Risk loss events, (2) Reassures quality of RCSA
- **External loss data:** (1) RCSA identifies areas of vulnerability that may benefit from considering fas-track external data, (2) Data helps determining potential weaknesses / inherent risks for RCSA
- **Scenario analysis:** (1) RCSA results serve a valuable input source; (2) Defining risk scenarios leads to identifying risk factors failed to be captured within RCSA.

## Key Risk Performance and Control Indicators

**Risk and Performance Indicators**
- Risk and performance indicators are risk metrics and/or statistics that provide insight into a bank's risk exposure.
- Risk indicators, often referred to as Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), are used to monitor the main drivers of exposure associated with key risks.
- Performance indicators, often referred to as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), provide insight into the status operational processes, which may in turn provide insight into operational weaknesses, failures, and potential losses.

**Indicators Approach to Monitoring Op Risk**
- Quantitative analysis without risk event collection
- Early checkup and qualitative projections
- Benchmarking of risk owners
- Targeted decision-making
- Validation of other identification tools

**Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- KRIs measure the frequency, severity, and impact of Op Risk events or corporate actions that occured during a reporting period.

|Risk Dimension | Idicators Type |
| -- | -- |
| Severity | (1) Volume of risk events, (2) Average risk losses, (3) Maximum duration of disruptions |
| Impact | (1) Total amount of risk losses, (2) Cost of mitigations |

**Qualities of Good Key Risk Indicators**
Qualities of Good KRIs:
- Ability to measure the right thing (e.g., supports the decisions that need to be made)
- Quantifiable (e.g. dmaages in dollars of profit loss)
- Capability to be measured precisely and accurately
- Ability to be validated against ground truth, and confidence level you have in the assertions made within the framework of the metric

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
KPIs are the measures that evaluate scale of banking acitivities.
- **Extension Risk:** (1) Gross Income, (2) Total Assets, (3) Book Value of Fixed Assets, (4) Cost to Income
- **People Risk:** (1) Number of Employees, (2) Staff Payroll, (3) Income per Employee, (4) Cost per Employee
- **Customer / Reputational Risk:** (1) Number of client accounts, (2) Volume of client accounts, (3) Average balance of single client account
- **Process Risk:** (1) Volume of transactions, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Average amount of single transaction

**Key Control Indicators (KCIs)**
KCIs are the measures to monitor the effectiveness of established Op Risk management procedures, collected from business units, Risk Management, Internal Audit reports, and Regulators
- **Business Units:** (1) Number of breaches identified by the staff, (2) Number of disciplinary actions taken, (3) Percentage of loss mitigation
- **Risk Management:** (1) Number of days before breaches are identified, (2) Number of action plans introduced, (3) Number of action plans failed to implement
- **Internal Audit:** (1) Number of breaches in processes identified by internal audit, (2) Number of breaches eliminated
- **Regulators:** (1) Number of claims on the Bank in the area of Op Risk made by the regulator, (2) Number of errors eliminated

**Key Control Indicators (KCIs)**
- A Key Control indicator quantifies how effectively a specific control tool, approach, or methodology is working.
- Key Control Indicators (KCIs) are used to define the company wide controls to and monitor the achievement of the set objectives.
- Managers define the related desired tolerances for controls before measuring.
- The KCIs role is to ensure that adequate responses and monitoring have been provided to a risk situation identified by KRIs.


## Risk-based Business Process Management

**Business Process Mapping**
- Business Process Mapping is a tool that may be used for identifying and assessing operation risk
- Business process mappings identify the key steps in business processes, acitivities and organizational functions. They also identify the key risk points in the overall business process.
- Process maps can reveal individual risks, risk interdependencies, and areas of control or risk management weakness. They also can help prioritize subsequent management action.
- Senior management should ensure that there is an approval process for all new products, activities, processes and systems that fully assesses operational risk.

**Business Process Mapping**
The review and approval process should consider:
- Inherent risks in the new product, service, or activity
- Changes to the bank's operational risk profile and appetite and tolerance, including the risk of existing products or activities
- Necessary controls, risk management processes, and risk mitigation strategies
- Residual risk
- Changes to relevant risk thresholds or limits
- Procedures and metrics to measure, monitor, and manage the risk of the new product or activity

**Process Risk Map**
- Process risk map is composed and monitored by Risk Management based on key workflows with the idea to identify and control inherent Op Risks 

**Control Objectives,  Procedures and Configuration**
- **Pre Event:** Design, Process Vulnerability, Compensating Control, Control Environment, People & Technology
- **Monitoring:** Monitoring, RCSA plan and checklists, Span of control, Residual risk indicators, Control effectiveness
- **Post Event:** Incident Management, Detection, Mitigation, Escalation, Prevention

## Risk Event Data Collection

**Losss Data Collection**
- **Internal Loss Data Collection and Analysis:** Internal operational loss data provides meaningful information for assessing a bank's exposure to operational risk and the effectiveness of internal controls. Analysis of loss events can provide insight into the causes of large losses and information on whether control failures are isolated or systematic.
- **External Data Collection and Analysis:** External data elements consist of gross operational loss amounts, dates, recoveries, and relevant causal information for operational loss events occurring at organizations other than the bank. External loss data can be compared with internal loss data, or used to explore possible weaknesses in the control environment or consider previously unidentified risk exposures. 

**Why Collect Data?**
- Immediate Actions
- Risk Reporting
- ORCom Decision Making
- Key Risk and Control Indicators
- Verifying Audit Reports
- Advanced Measurment Approaches

**5 Steps in Developing Database**
- (1) Classify business lines, risk, loss types
- (2) Define risk relevant data and data sources
- (3) Make database, reporting templates
- (4) Management buy-in, assign roles
- (5) Test the process

**Database Classifications**
(1) Business Areas </br>
- Corporate Finance
- Trading & Sales
- Retail Banking
- Commercial Banking
- Payment and Settlement
- Agency Services
- Asset Management
- Retail Brokerage

(2) Risk event types </br>
- Internal fraud
- External fraud
- Employment Practices and Workplace Safety
- Clients, Products & Business Practices
- Damage to Physical Assets 
- Business disruption and system failures
- Execution, Delivery & Process Management

(3) Loss Types </br>
- Direct: Client compensations, Staff payments, Replacement costs, Fees and penalties, Write-offs
- Pending
- Losses
- Provisions
- Indirect: Timing losses, Opportunity costs, Enhancement costs, Insurance premiums

**External Loss Data**
Lack of internal observations -> No data integrity and granularity -> Low confidence level for measuring risk -> Incorrect decision making -> Need for external data

**Key Risk Reports: Severity Distribution**
Report shows distribution of frequency and loss amount by loss severity brackets

**Key Risk Reports: Summary Report**
Report aggregates frequency and loss amount by business/risk types 

## Capital Requirements

**Operational Risk in Regulatory Capital Requirements**
- Complex in causes, sources and manifestations
- No well-established quantitative approaches
- Multiple skills required (technical knowledge, self-learning capacity)
- Op Risk capital ranges from 18-45% of total regulatory capital for large U.S. banks

**BCBS Operational Risk Capital**
Operational RWA: a component of the capital ratio denominator
- (Adjusted Common Equity*)/(Credit RWA + Market RWA + Operational RWA) = Common Equity%

**The Standardized Approach**
- More accurate approach sensitive to business line segmentation 
- **Advantages:** (1) Fairly simple, (2) Specific to business type
- **Shortcomings:** (1) Linear relationship with risk driver, (2) Exposure indicator is distorted with business cycle (lower in downturn, higher in upturn)

**The Standardized Approach: Requirements**
Minimum qualifying criteria for the Standardized Approach:
- Management oversight of ORM framework
- Soundness and integrity of ORM system
- Sufficient resources in ORM across major business lines, control and audit
- Specific policies developed and criteria documented for mapping gross income for current business lines and activities

- Provisions
- Risk management + Audit Integrity Check

(5) Follow-up
- Controls
- Mitigations 
- Early warning signals
- Continuity plans
- Expert Groups + OR Committee

**Writing Scenario Algorithms**

- Defining and structuring the task, specifying the area of interest and identifying the major relevant features of this area.
- Describing important external factors and their influence on the area of interest. These factors form the influence fields.
- Identifying major descriptors for each field and making assumptions about their future trends.
- Checking the consistency of possible combinations of alternative assumptions regarding the critical descriptors and identifying assumption bundles.
- Combining assumptions with the trend assumptions regarding the uncritical depicters, resulting in a scenario for each field. 
- Making assumptions with respect to possible interfering events and their probabilities as well as their impacts on the field.
- Assessing the impact of the field scenarios on the area of interest and its depicters. Respective scenarios are contructed.
- Identifying strategies that could promote or impede the developments described in the scenarios.

**What Scnearios Are Relevant?**

- Scenario requirements: Low frequency, High severity, Realistic to the Bank
- If low frequency, low severity: Internal Loss Data
- If high frequency, low severity: RCSA, Key risk indicators, Audit findings

**Forward-looking Focus**

- Scneario data provides a forward-looking view of potential operational risk exposures, based on historical or judgmental estimations.

**Data Collection**

- **Data sources:** (1) External loss data, (2) Internal loss data, (3) KRI/KPI, (4) RCSA, (5) Expert opinions
- **Data types/updates:** (1) Major changes, (2) Extreme losses, (3) At least annually revised
- **Collection process:** (1) Workshops (expert group), (2) Interviews (business lines), (3) Questionnaires (business lines), (4) Regular meetings (ORCom), (5) Voting (expert group)
- **Data scope:** (1) Bank-wide scenarios, (2) Busienss line scenarios, (3) Subgroup scenarios

**Scenario Risk Drivers**

- RCSA may help to identify the business lines and event types of high impact

**High Severity Scenario Examples**

- Large loan or card fraud (internal/external)
- High-scale unauthorized trading
- Legislation non-compliance or incomplete disclosure (banking, tax, AML regulation)
- Massive technology failure or new system migration
- Server disruptions/network shutdown that cause outages and loss of information 
- Mergers and acquisitions with other banks
- Doubling the bank's maximum historical loss amount
- Increase of loss frequency by 20%
- Increase of loss severity by 50%/100%

**Scenario Biases**

- **Overconfidence:** Underestimation of risk due to the number of observed events being small
- **Availability:** Overestimation of events that respondents had closer or more recent contact with as personally experienced events are usually more prominent, as are recent events
- **Anchoring:** When people are asked to estimate range for uncertain events, they use a starting point (anchor), and this may create a tendency for experts to overestimate success and underestimate failures.
- **Motivation:** Misrepresentation of information due to respondents' interests in conflict with the goals and consequences of the assessment.
- **Partition dependence:** Refers to whether the respondents' knowledge was distorted by discrete choices of responses had to be represented, which may lead to underestimation of low frequency events and overestimation of high frequency events depending on expert experience.
- **Framing:** Outcomes from questionnaires are sensitive to the phrasing and the order of questions used. 
- Banks are likely to deviate from true risk estimate due to low frequency of events, too much reliance on recent data, and conflicts of interest

**Robust Scenario Framework**

Scenario creators can ensure the integrity and consistency their estimates using the following practices:
- 1. Clearly defined and repeatable process
- 2. Good quality background preparation of the participants
- 3. Qualified and experienced facilitators
- 4. Representatives of the business, subject matter experts and risk managers
- 5. Structured process for the selection of data for scenario parameters
- 6. High quality documentation of the scenario formulation and outputs
- 7. Robust independent challenge process and oversight by risk management
- 8. Process that is responsive to internal and external changes
- 9. Mechanisms for mitigating biases inherent in scenario processes

## Operational Risk Framework

**Stages of ORM Development in a Bank**

- (1) **Starting Point:** Internal Audit, Predominantly Reactive Measures, Safety Mindedness, Error Avoidance, Risk Aversion
- (2) **Creating the Basis:** Op Risk Unit, Proactive Control, Framework and Strategy
- (3) **Implementation:** Self-Assessment, Collection of Loss Data, Database
- (4) **Enhancements, Ongoing, Adaptation:** Key Risk Indicators, Business process analysis, Scenario Analysis, op Risk Reporting, Op VaR
- (5) **Integration:** Bank-wide Allocation, Enterprise Risk Management

**Goals of Operational Risk Management**
- Understand How Op Risk is Incurred, Op Risk Potential Impact, Level of Control, Allocate Budgets for Risk Reduction Capital
- Leads to: Increase Results, Reduce Risks, Improve Product Quality

**Risk Culture**

Includes
- Integrity and ethical values
- Management philosophy & operating style
- Organizational structure
- Delegation of authority & responsibility
- HR policies and practices
- Staff competencies

Driven by:
- BOD & senior management commitment
- HR practices
- OR training and awareness compaigns
- Working environment
- Communication style (internal as well as disclosure to stakholders of ORM practices and position)

**Managing Op Risk through a Framework**

How Ops Risk has been managed in the past:
- 4-eyes principles
- Separation of functions
- Allocation of responsibilities and limits
- Internal controls and their review by auditors

ORM must be an embedded process!
- Prevention ahead of correction 
- Ongoing questioning of 6Ss - Strategy, Structure, Systems, Safety, Simplicity, Speed
- Risk awareness for everyone
- Promote a risk culture rather than controlling numbers

**Op Risk Management Framework Implementation**

1. Identification 
- Start loss collection infrastruture (internal losses, external losses)
- Describe potential losses by structured info: - preventive measures for high-risk areas, - disseminate information via internal communication channels
2. Assessment
- Find quantifiable means to track
- Create Reporting mechanism
- Involve business units
- Invest in automated data gathering & workflow technologies
3. Measurement
- Developing & refining modeling approach
- Create Op Risk Data
- Technology Development
- Implement advanced tools: - risk indicators, - scneario analyses, -business process analyses
4. Integration
- Integrate OR exposure data into management process
- Engage senior management
- Manage exposure
- Invest in processes (limited tech & manual processes)



## Operational Risk Corporate Governance

**Op Risk Corporate Governance**
- Clear Org Structure with defined lines of responsibility
- Hierarchical decision-making process
- Adequate internal control structures proportionate to the scale of Org's activities
- Output of RM system must be integrated into the control of operational risk profile
- Internal & External Assessment to ensure the ORM framework serves its purpose

**Risk Governance: 4 Lines of Defense**
1. **Business Manager** have primary responsibility for managing their risks (Risk-takers)
2. **Independent Corporate ORM fucntion** - supports the line management, responsible for risk oversight and guidance
3. **Independent assurance**, consists of **verification** (tests the efficiency of the overall framework) and **validation** (ensures the robustness of quantification) - **internal/external audit**
4. **Board of Directors**
