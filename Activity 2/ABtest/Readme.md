# A/B Testing

## Overview

- A/B testing compares the performance of two versions of content to see which one appeals more to visitors/viewers.
- It takes a control (A) version against a variant (B) version to measure which one is most successful based on your key metrics.
- A/B testing plays an important role in campaign management since it helps determine what is and isn't working. It allows you to compare and contrast the performance of two different approaches to identify the better one.

**AB Testing Steps:**
- Understanding business problem & data
- Detect and resolve problems in the data (Missing Value, Outliers, Unexpected Value)
- Look summary stats and plots
- Apply hypothesis testing and check assumptions
    - Check Normality & Homogeneity
    - Apply tests (Shapiro, Levene Test, T-Test, Welch Test, Mann Whitney U Test)
- Evaluate the results
- Make inferences
- Recommend business decision to your customer/director/ceo etc.

In this dataset, we will perform test on three perspectives:

(1) **All users:** The whole dataset

(2) **Paid users:** Filter the dataset with only paid user

(3) **Multiple visit users:** Filter the dataset with users that have multiple visits
