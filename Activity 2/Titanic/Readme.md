**Variable Notes**
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower
age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
