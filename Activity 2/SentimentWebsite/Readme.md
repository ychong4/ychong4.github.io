## Natural Language Processing
**1. Sentiment Analysis:** This is a sentiment analysis feature where some NLP models are used to analyze the sentiment in a sentence, whether it is a positive or negative sentiment. When the user upload csv file for analysis, the sentiment distribution plot and word cloud can be generated and can be downloaded.

**2. Chatbot:** This is a chatbot built with using the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model from Hugging Face. User can interact with the chatbot to get their questions answered. (Performance issue due to lack of GPU computing power)

## Computer Vision
1. Image-To-Text: This is a feature aims to convert handwritten text in images into digital text using advanced handwriting recognition technology. The users can upload images of handwritten notes, and this tool processes and translates the visual text into machine-readable text, making it easy to digitize and search handwritten documents.

## Time-Series
**1. Stock Price Prediction**: This feature includes an automated and scalable ETL pipeline to extract daily stock price of some mega cap stocks using Polygon.io API. The stock prices are processed using Facebook's Prophet model and it predicts the stock price for the next 5-day periods.
