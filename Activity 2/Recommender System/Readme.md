## Recommender System

Recommender systems are the algorithms that aimed at suggesting relevant products/services to users to boost your sales.

**Benefits of using recommender system:**
1. Link the users to the right products.
2. Increase user engagement.
3. Make personalized contents/ads.

**Types of recommendations:**
1. Popularity based recommender system: Recommend items based on ratings from most people.
2. Classification model based recommender system: Using classification model to determine if user will like the product.
3. Content based recommender system: Assume that user would like items that are similar to other items.  
4. Collaborative filtering: Assume that people likes things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste. i) User-user, ii) item-item
5. Hybrid approach: Combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches.
6. Association rule mining: Association rules capture the relationships between items based on their patterns of co-occurrence across transactions.

**Notebooks Information:**
1. **Recommender system for Amazon product:** This notebook introduces the use of popularity-based recommendation system and collaborative filtering recommendation. Popularity-based recommendation is the engine to recommend items to customers based on the hot trend in the item database, which means more ratings counts from users. Collaborative filtering recommends items to customer based on the item they rated previously. The recommender engine lookup for items that have similar ratings from users and recommend them to the specific user based on his/her activity.
2. **Recommender-System-movies:** In this notebook, the deep learning libraries for recommendation system, Tensorflow Recommender System (TFRS) is explored and used to build a recommendation system. This notebook only includes the shallow model, while deeper model can be added into future research list.
